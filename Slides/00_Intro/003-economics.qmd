## Foundations

What we will be learning in this course will seem simplistic and reductive to the world we actually observe

But these foundations help us set up a lot of cool research (that may not even seem like it is Economics)

. . .

- Do international free trade agreements impact political polarization in developing countries?

. . .

- How does the city you live in affect your economic mobility: Evidence from Japanese Internment Camps in WWII

. . .

- [Other Research Here]{.hi-red}

Before we jump into Intermediate Microeconomics, we need to refresh our memories of more basic concepts from EC 201

- Demand

- Supply 

- Economic Assumptions
